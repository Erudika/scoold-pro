---------------------------------

IMPORTANT: THIS SOFTWARE END-USER LICENSE AGREEMENT ("EULA") IS A LEGAL AGREEMENT (“Agreement”) BETWEEN YOU (THE CUSTOMER, EITHER AS AN INDIVIDUAL OR, IF PURCHASED OR OTHERWISE ACQUIRED BY OR FOR AN ENTITY, AS AN ENTITY) AND ERUDIKA. READ IT CAREFULLY BEFORE COMPLETING THE INSTALLATION PROCESS AND USING SCOOLD PRO AND RELATED SOFTWARE COMPONENTS (“SOFTWARE”). IT PROVIDES A LICENSE TO USE THE SOFTWARE AND CONTAINS WARRANTY INFORMATION AND LIABILITY DISCLAIMERS. BY INSTALLING AND USING THE SOFTWARE, YOU ARE CONFIRMING YOUR ACCEPTANCE OF THE SOFTWARE AND AGREEING TO BECOME BOUND BY THE TERMS OF THIS AGREEMENT.

This EULA agreement governs your acquisition and use of our Scoold software ("Software") directly from Erudika or indirectly through a Erudika authorized reseller or distributor (a "Reseller").

If you register for a free trial of the Scoold software, this EULA agreement will also govern that trial. By clicking "accept" or installing and/or using the Scoold software, you are confirming your acceptance of the Software and agreeing to become bound by the terms of this EULA agreement.

If you are entering into this EULA agreement on behalf of a company or other legal entity, you represent that you have the authority to bind such entity and its affiliates to these terms and conditions. If you do not have such authority or if you do not agree with the terms and conditions of this EULA agreement, do not install or use the Software, and you must not accept this EULA agreement.

This EULA agreement shall apply only to the Software supplied by Erudika herewith regardless of whether other software is referred to or described herein. The terms also apply to any Erudika updates, supplements, Internet-based services, and support services for the Software, unless other terms accompany those items on delivery. If so, those terms apply.

You must purchase a license for each Host running in a production environment. The source code is not provided with this type of license.

You must purchase a license for each Host running in a production environment. The source code for the Software is provided with this type of license.

After the end of that period, you can renew the license to continue receiving updates, fixes and getting access to the source code.

The source code for the Software is provided with this type of license. You are eligible for 1 (one) year worth of Software updates and bug fixes.
