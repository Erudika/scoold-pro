**Scoold** is a Q&A platform written in Java. The project was created back in 2008, released in 2012 as social network for
schools inspired by StackOverflow, and as of 2017 it has been refactored, repackaged and open-sourced.
The primary goal of this project is educational but it can also work great as a Q&A/support section for your website.

Scoold can run on Heroku or any other PaaS. It's lightweight (~4000 LOC) - the backend is handled by a separate service called
[Para](https://github.com/Erudika/para). Scoold does not require a database, and the controller logic is really simple
because all the heavy lifting is delegated to Para. This makes the code easy to read and can be learned quickly by junior developers.

**This repository exists mainly for tracking issues.**
